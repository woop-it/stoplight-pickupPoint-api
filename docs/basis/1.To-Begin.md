# To begin

To begin, all technical information about Woop APIs for partners is contained in this documentation. For any questions or clarifications, please contact the internal technical team.

To use the APIs, you will need the login information you received when your account has been created on the platform.

This document contains a section illustrating the exchanges possible between Woop and the Partner:
- `Partner to Woop` Which describes the overall operation of the APIs (response) from the partner to Woop.

- `Woop to Partner` Which generally describes how Woop's APIs work when calling a partner.
